# HumanSilhoutteExtraction

Objective of this study is to develop an algorithm that is capable of detecting the presence of human based on motion and background subtraction technique to extract foreground pixels from its background thus separating the human silhouettes. The extracted silhouette is used for bio-metric or human detection. #silhouette #humandetection

Using parallel computing techniques, a real time system can be designed to extract silhouettes in real time. Experments have been done with parallel computing at image level and frame level for silhoutte extraction. These silhouettes can be used as input to a gait analysis bio-metric system for human identification.
